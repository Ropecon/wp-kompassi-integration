**Filtering Program**

You can filter the program by text search and categories with the menu found under the _Filter_ button. You can choose one or multiple values per category.

By choosing values from a negative filter, all program numbers with the selected values will be hidden.

**List View**

* When using text search, results are sorted by relevance rather than chronologically.
* When limiting search results by date, programs which have started in previous days that are still continuing are listed at the end of the search results.

**Timeline View**

You can zoom and pan the timeline view:

* On desktop, use _Shift + mouse wheel_ to zoom.
* On a touch screen, pinch to zoom.
* Drag to pan on all devices.

**Other Tips**

* When you have a program popup open, _swip left_ to move quickly to the next (visible) program number. On a desktop, you can use _the arrow keys_.
* You can find links to enroll and add to calendar from the program popups.
